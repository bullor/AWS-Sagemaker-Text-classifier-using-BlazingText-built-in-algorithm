__label__0 "i 'm a bit disappointed in this top . i 'm keeping because retailer 's shipping rates are obnoxious and i do n't have a store near me . by the time i pay for shipping both ways i could have paid for 1/2 the shirt . the loft has some very similar tops for about 1/2 the price . i love meadow rue and their material is fabulous but the design is off on this one . you ca n't size down because the armholes and top are fitted but the bottom is a tent . not my usual style as i 'm short with a short waist . this"
__label__1 "i a looking forward to wearing this dress with a jean or leather jacket . the dress is well made and the fringe adds a nice detail to the otherwise basic design . be sure to order a couple of sizes smaller than your regular size because the dress is huge . i ordered the dress in both colors and am keeping the blue ."
__label__0 "i wore this coat one day and the buttons started falling off . it stretched so much . i 'm going to beg my local store to take back . it should n't fall apart like that . it 's super duper cozy though ."
__label__-1 "crew stripe sheath fitted very well until i turned around . the waist section where the stripes wrap around the waist had extra fabric and did n't lay well . i am 5 ' 4 120 lbs 32c 26 waist and 32 hip usually wear a 0 or extra small in the maeve clothing that is n't a fitted style . i bought the s which fit well except for the waist issue described above . this is a fitted dress . i hope this is just an issue with the dress i received . it is a great style idea ."
__label__0 "this is a cute dress but the buttons are tiny and the top one cracked in half before i could even put the dress on . i ca n't risk the buttons breaking off while i am wearing it . especially since the dress seems designed for an a cup anything larger will be more than those little fragile buttons can handle ."
__label__1 "this is very cute . i got a lot of compliments when i wore it . i 'm 5'10 so i always struggle with tops being too short but this was ok"
__label__0 "such a cute dress it was just way too big in the back of the dress too much fabric it just hung with no form around waist . it appeared more fitted on the model than the one i received . dress was quite a bit longer in the back so i felt like the front was riding up just in the minutes of trying it on . sadly i have to return it . it did come with an underneath slip which was necessary as the fabric was very thin . recommend with caution to sizing ."
__label__0 "this skirt and top is nothing like the picture . the skirt is black not maroon . top is also black . although the skirt is nice the image was fabulous . the side panels of the skirt are also a knit . quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is . would have expected suede or leather panels for the money . not sure if going to keep or not . was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black ."
__label__0 "i ordered the petite in my size since i 'm well petite but curvy . i recommend this dress if you do n't have a lot of boobage . unfortunately for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way . its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it . it fits but just is not flattering because of my boobs . this is always my problem though with dresses ."
__label__1 "i just got this top and ca n't wait to wear it for spring/summer ! it is a lovely lightweight material and hangs loosely and comfortably . it definitely runs quite large so i would at the very least consider ordering on the small side of what you normally wear if not sizing down one completely . this is coming from someone who usually likes tops on the roomier side so trust me on this ! overall i highly recommend this top if you 're looking for a muted but unique comfy top for the warmer months ahe"
__label__-1 "the product looked more or less as expected but the fabric felt very cheap . not the quality i would expect from retailer . the shirt is also very short which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of ."
__label__-1 "this top looks beautiful online . when i got it it looks nothing like the pic . it 's wide too much fabric no shape and so unflattering . it 's definitely going back"
__label__1 "i sadly only noticed this top once on sale . i tried on the xs and it was just a bit big i would need the petite so i had to leave it behind ( 115 lbs 30dd ) - but it is adorable can be dressed up and classy casually with jeans or sweetly so many ways ... love the subtle polka dots ... oh well i am sure i will find something similar i love !"
__label__1 "i wear between a l and xl .. i chose the xl which was the right choice .. if you are a bit curvy in proportions i could size up . the color is gorgeous ... i just logged back on to order another if there were options but alas there are not . flattering arm cut ! could be worn for work or with jeans/ out to dinner . it 's cute you wo n't regret it ! ( as a side note it is sheer ... which you can see in the photo . needs a cami )"
__label__0 "the design of these is adorable with the lace up ties however they are a dingy looking off white color . they are also pretty see through . returned ."
__label__-1 "this was so unflattering . the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs . the green was a beautiful vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag ."
__label__0 "cute dress- flattering and seems to be well made . however when i received it it seemed that it had been worn . the bottom was all dirty and it had a white mark at the top . called and rep said they would send new dress if i send first back so hopefully that gets here quickly and in good shape . the other dress i place with my order has n't even shipped and the rep could n't tell me when/if it would ."
__label__1 "this is just a fantastic dress ! i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove . i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps : ) i took the regular length and found it perfect . the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower . i 'm only 51 but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for me definitely a keeper !"
__label__-1 "this suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal . it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out . i was very sad to return it : ( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium"
__label__0 "i purchased this and it ended up sitting in my closet for a couple of weeks . i bought it in the green and i felt it did nothing to enhance my figure . it 's kind of a boring design . i like the cowl neck ( rare on a tunic ) and the sleeve details . the colors do n't seem to go well with standard black leggings . overall unimpressed ."
__label__1 "i bought one of these tees and i washed it a few times and luckily no holes yet like other reviews have stated . i just got a 2nd tee as they are quite comfy . i bought these both in-store but the petite size might have been better for my frame . i wish retailer would look into having petite sizes available in store and not just online . sometimes i do get lucky on finding petite sizes in-store but it 's usually from a return ."
__label__0 "i love the design and color of this cardigan and the way it was styled in the store display made me snatch one up right away . but unfortunately it 's huge and shapeless ( i tried size xs/s ) and i 'm a waif ( 5 ' 2 105 # ) - i think it could drape nicely on a tall woman but if you are small to average in height it 'll hang down somewhere mid-thigh or even lower . you can snug up the ties as they are threaded through the cardigan like a drawstring but that just made it look bunchy and even more shapel"
__label__-1 "i love this tank it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws . it rolls up every time i walk or do anything it becomes very bothersome ."
__label__-1 "based on the strength of the other reviews i thought this sweater would be amazing but i was disappointed . the knit is very thin cheap looking and weak that it wo n't last a season undamaged . it reminds me of a duster i bought 15 years ago at a discount fast-fashion retailer when i was a student . sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package . collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare . the drape is not structured enough -- everything about this screams over priced bath"
__label__0 "this dress is very cute on the model online but in person it is quite large and just hands there and does n't do much for the figure . cute but not worth the $ 148 price tag ."
__label__-1 "the colors in this dress are beautiful ( the green/blue version ) but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy . i purchased it online and was n't expecting it to be so sheer -- the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown i really wanted to love it but it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "i had high hopes with the other positive reviews but it did n't work on me . nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and did n't lay well and did n't do my bust any favors . maybe better on those less pear shaped . hopeless on me ."
